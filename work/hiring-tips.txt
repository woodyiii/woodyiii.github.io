If someone is applying to our company and has never been deeply obsessed about something before, then it’s a bad bet to think Scale will be the first. I have a particular line of questioning around this:

1. What’s the hardest you’ve ever worked on something?
2. How many hours were you working a week?
3. Why did you work so hard? Why did you care?
4. When were you the most unmotivated in your life?
5. What’s the thing you’re the most proud of?
6. Do you think it was worth it?

For an obsessed person, it’s always worth it.
